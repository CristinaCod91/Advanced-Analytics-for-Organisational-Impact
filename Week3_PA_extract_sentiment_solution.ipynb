    "An interior design company wants to gain more insights into how its customers are experiencing its products and services, and they’ve asked you to help! To get a brief overview of existing customer satisfaction, they would like to determine the percentage of customer reviews that express negative, positive, or neutral sentiments. The company has received several reviews from past customers on the Google business page.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will use the `vaderSentiment` library (an existing Python lexicon and rule-based sentiment analysis tool) to extract sentiment scores from these customer reviews. VADER stands for **V**alence **A**ware **D**ictionary and s**E**ntiment **R**easoner. It relies on a dictionary and a set of rules to extract meaning from text. The `vaderSentiment` library is optimised to analyse sentiments expressed in informal channels, such as customer reviews and social media commentary. This means that it processes text with emojis, slang, and unusual punctuation really well. Since this library doesn’t require training, you can use it right away for this activity.\n",
